The final step in your capstone journey is presenting your work. This chapter helps you prepare an effective presentation that demonstrates both your technical accomplishments and your growth with AI-assisted development.

## Presentation Overview

Each presentation should be 8-10 minutes, covering:
1. Project demonstration (4-5 minutes)
2. AI collaboration highlights (2-3 minutes)
3. Reflection and lessons learned (2 minutes)

## Preparing Your Demo

### Structure Your Walkthrough

Plan a logical flow through your application:

**For Greenfield Project (Finance Tracker):**
1. Dashboard overview—show summary statistics
2. Add a transaction—demonstrate the form
3. Show filtering—category and date range
4. Show updated dashboard—reflect the changes
5. Show data persistence—refresh and verify

**For Brownfield Project (Shopping Cart):**
1. Browse coins—show existing functionality
2. Add to cart—demonstrate new feature
3. Navigate to cart—show cart persists
4. Adjust quantities—show controls working
5. Checkout—complete the flow
6. Show order in database.json

### Practice Your Demo

Before presenting:
- Run through the demo 2-3 times
- Ensure the backend is running
- Have sample data that tells a good story
- Know what you'll click and in what order
- Prepare for common issues (clear cache, restart servers)

### Handle Technical Issues

Things will go wrong. Plan for it:

- Have screenshots ready as backup
- Know how to restart quickly
- Keep calm and explain what should happen
- "Let me show you the code instead"

## Highlighting AI Collaboration

This is the unique part of your presentation. Show how you worked with Claude Code.

### Prepare 2-3 Specific Examples

**Example types to consider:**

1. **A great prompt that worked well**
   - Show the prompt
   - Explain why it was effective
   - Show what Claude produced

2. **A time you had to course-correct**
   - What did Claude get wrong initially?
   - How did you redirect?
   - What was the result?

3. **Something surprising Claude did**
   - A clever solution you didn't expect
   - A problem it identified that you missed
   - An edge case it handled automatically

4. **A debugging success**
   - Describe the bug
   - Show how Claude investigated
   - Explain the fix

### Show, Don't Just Tell

If possible, prepare:
- Screenshots of interesting prompts
- Code snippets Claude generated
- Before/after of a refactoring

### Be Honest About Challenges

Authenticity matters:
- Where did AI assistance not help?
- What did you have to do yourself?
- What was harder than expected?

## Reflection Points

Prepare thoughtful answers to these questions:

### About AI-Assisted Development

- How did your workflow change compared to traditional coding?
- What tasks was Claude most helpful for?
- When did you choose to write code yourself instead?
- How did you know when to trust Claude's output?

### About Your Learning

- What concept from the course clicked during the project?
- What would you do differently if starting over?
- What technique will you use in future projects?
- What surprised you about working this way?

### About the Project

- What are you most proud of?
- What would you add with more time?
- What was the hardest part?
- How does the final result compare to your initial plan?

## Presentation Tips

### Speaking

- **Pace yourself**: You have more time than you think
- **Explain as you go**: Don't assume the audience follows
- **Make eye contact**: Look at people, not just the screen
- **Use transitions**: "Now let me show you...", "One interesting thing was..."

### Technical

- **Increase font size**: Code should be readable from the back
- **Use dark theme**: Easier to see in presentation lighting
- **Close unnecessary windows**: Reduce visual clutter
- **Turn off notifications**: Nothing kills a demo like a message popup

### Content

- **Lead with the demo**: People want to see it work
- **Be specific with examples**: "Claude suggested using..." not "It was helpful"
- **Own your work**: You made decisions; Claude assisted
- **End strong**: Close with your key learning or proudest moment

## Presentation Checklist

### The Day Before

- [ ] Run complete demo without issues
- [ ] Prepare 3 AI collaboration examples
- [ ] Write brief notes for each section
- [ ] Have database with good sample data
- [ ] Test screen sharing if presenting remotely

### Right Before

- [ ] Restart backend and frontend servers
- [ ] Open browser to starting point
- [ ] Close all other applications
- [ ] Have backup screenshots accessible
- [ ] Take a deep breath

### During

- [ ] Introduce yourself and project
- [ ] Walk through demo smoothly
- [ ] Share specific AI examples
- [ ] Reflect on learning
- [ ] Thank the audience

## Answering Questions

Be prepared for questions like:

**About your project:**
- "Why did you choose that approach?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- "How would you extend this feature?"

**About AI collaboration:**
- "Did Claude ever lead you in a wrong direction?"
- "How did you decide what to ask Claude vs. do yourself?"
- "What was your most effective prompt?"

**About the technology:**
- "Why did you use [X] instead of [Y]?"
- "How does [specific feature] work?"
- "What would break if [scenario]?"

### Good Question Responses

- "That's a great question. [Answer]"
- "I actually struggled with that. Here's what I learned..."
- "If I had more time, I would..."
- "I'm not sure, but I would investigate by..."

### It's OK to Say

- "I don't know, but I could find out by..."
- "That's beyond what I implemented, but..."
- "I hadn't considered that—interesting idea"

- AI-assisted development
- Prompt engineering
- Iterative building
- Working with existing code
- Leveraging external tools

Show that journey. The imperfect parts, the learning moments, the breakthroughs—they all tell the story of becoming an AI-augmented developer.

Good luck with your presentations!
